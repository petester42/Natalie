# Natalie
Natalie - Storyboard Code Generator (for Swift)

## Synopsis
Script generate Swift code based on storyboard files to make work with Storyboards and segues easier. Generated file **reduce usage of Strings** as identifiers for Segues or Storyboards.

This is a proof of concept to address the String issue for strongly typed Swift language. Natalie is a Swift script (written in Swift) that produces a single `.swift` file with a bunch of extensions to project classes along the generated Storyboard enum.

Since Natalie is a Swift script, that means it is written in Swift and requires Swift to run. The project uses [SWXMLHash](https://github.com/drmohundro/SWXMLHash) as a dependency to parse XML and due to framework limitations all code is in a single file.

###Enumerate Storyboards
Generated enum Storyboards with convenient interface (drop-in replacement for UIStoryboard).

```swift
struct Storyboards {
    struct Main {...}
    struct Second {...}
    ...
```

Instantiate initial view controller for storyboard
```swift
let vc = Storyboards.Main.instantiateInitialViewController()
```

Instantiate ScreenTwoViewController in storyboard, using storyboard id
```swift
let vc = Storyboards.Main.instantiateScreenTwoViewController()
```

example usage for prepareForSegue()

```swift
override func prepareForSegue(segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: AnyObject?) {
  if segue == MainViewController.Segue.ScreenOneSegue {	
	let viewController = segue.destinationViewController as? MyViewController
    viewController?.view.backgroundColor = UIColor.yellowColor()
  }
}
```

...it could be `switch { }` statement, but [it's broken](https://twitter.com/krzyzanowskim/status/611686899732869121).

###Enumerate Nibs
Generated enum Nibs with convenient interface (drop-in replacement for UINib).

```swift
struct Nibs {
    struct LaunchScreen {...}
    struct TableViewCell {...}
    struct RoundedButton {...}
    ...
```

Instantiate view from nib
```swift
let view = Nibs.RoundedButton.view
```

###Segues

Perform segue
```swift
self.performSegue(MainViewController.Segue.ScreenOneSegue, sender:nil)
```

Each custom view controller is extended with this code and provide list of available segues and additional informations from Storyboard.

`Segue` enumeration contains list of available segues

`kind` property represent types Segue

`destination` property return type of destination view controller.

```swift
extension MainViewController { 

    enum Segue: String, Printable, SegueProtocol {
        case ScreenOneSegueButton = "Screen One Segue Button"
        case ScreenOneSegue = "ScreenOneSegue"

        var kind: SegueKind? {
            ...
        }

        var destination: UIViewController.Type? {
            switch (self) {
            case ScreenOneSegueButton:
                return ScreenOneViewController.self
            case ScreenOneSegue:
                return ScreenOneViewController.self
            default:
                assertionFailure("Unknown destination")
                return nil
            }
        }

        var identifier: String { return self.description } 
        var description: String { return self.rawValue }
    }
}
```

###Reusable Views To Improve Performance

Collections and tables views use `reuseidentifier` on cell to recycle a view.

If you define it, their custom view controllers will be extended with an `Reusable` enumeration, which contains list of available reusable identifiers

example to dequeue a view with `Reusable` enumeration with `UITableView`:
```swift
func tableView(tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAtIndexPath indexPath: NSIndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
    let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(ScreenTwoViewController.Reusable.MyCell, forIndexPath: indexPath) as! UITableViewCell
    cell.textLabel?.text = "\(indexPath.row)"
    return cell
}
```

Before dequeuing your view, you must register a class or a xib for each identifier.
If your cell view has custom class defined in storyboard, in your controller you can call directly
```swift
override func viewDidLoad()  {
    tableView.registerReusableCell(MainViewController.Reusable.MyCell)
}
```
You can pass the view instead - the view must define the `reuseidentifier`
```swift
    tableView.registerReusableCell(tableViewCell)
```

If your custom reusable view, you can also execute code according to reusable values
```swift
class MyCustomTableViewCell: UITableViewCell {
    override func prepareForReuse() {
        if self == MyCustomTableViewController.Reusable.MyCell {
            ...
        }
        else if self == MyCustomTableViewController.Reusable.mySecondCellId {
            ...
        }
    }
}
```

##Installation

There is no need to do any installation, however if you want easy Xcode integration you may want to install the script to be easily accessible for any application from `/usr/local/bin`

```
$ brew install natalie
```

or

```
$ git clone https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/Natalie.git
$ sudo cp natalie.swift /usr/local/bin/natalie.swift
```

###Xcode Integration

Natalie can be integrated with Xcode in such a way that the `Storyboards.swift` file will be updated with every build of the project, so you don't have to do it manually every time.

This is my setup created with **New Run Script Phase** on **Build Phase** Xcode target setting. It is important to move this phase above Compilation phase because this file is expected to be up to date for the rest of the application.

```sh
echo "Natalie Generator: Determining if generated Swift file is up-to-date."

NATALIE_PATH="/usr/local/bin/natalie.swift"

if [ -f $NATALIE_PATH ]
then
	BASE_PATH="$PROJECT_DIR/$PROJECT_NAME"
	OUTPUT_PATH="$BASE_PATH/Storyboards.swift"
	if [ ! -e "$OUTPUT_PATH" ] || [ -n "$(find "$BASE_PATH" -type f -name "*.storyboard" -o -name "*.xib" -newer "$OUTPUT_PATH" -print -quit)" ]; then
		echo "Natalie Generator: Generated Swift is out-of-date; re-generating..."
	    "$NATALIE_PATH" "$PROJECT_DIR/$PROJECT_NAME" > "$PROJECT_DIR/$PROJECT_NAME/Storyboards.swift"
		echo "Natalie Generator: Done."
	else
		echo "Natalie Generator: Generated Swift is up-to-date; skipping re-generation."
	fi
fi
```

Don't forget to add `Storyboards.swift` to the project.

##Usage:

Download Natalie from Github: https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/Natalie and use it in the console, for example like this:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/Natalie.git
$ cd Natalie
```

The script expects one of two types of parameters:

* path to a single .storyboard file 
* path to a folder

If the parameter is a Storyboard file, then this file will be used. If a path to a folder is provided Natalie will generate code for every storyboard found inside.

```
$ natalie.swift NatalieExample/NatalieExample/Base.lproj/Main.storyboard > NatalieExample/NatalieExample/Storyboards.swift
```
